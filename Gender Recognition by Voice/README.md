This projects uses Machine Learning models to predict gender by voice and speech analysis.
This database was created to identify a voice as male or female, based upon acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz (human vocal range).
