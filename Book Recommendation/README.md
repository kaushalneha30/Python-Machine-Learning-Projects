# Book Recommendation System

This project uses book readers data and recommends books based on their ratings to other books.

There are three datasets:

 - Books - Book information: ISBN number, book title, author, year of publication and publisher.
 - Book-Ratings - User ID, ISBN number and book ratings
 - Users - User ID, location and age
 
By combining three datasets, a final recommendation of top 5 books closest to the selected book is made.
